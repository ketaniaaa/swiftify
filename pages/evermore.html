                The deluxe edition contains the bonus tracks “right where you left me” and “it’s time to go”.
                
                As with its ‘sister record’ folklore, the writing on evermore was a collaborative effort between Swift, Aaron Dessner (of The National), Jack Antonoff, William Bowery, and Bon Iver. The record is notable for containing three artist features (HAIM, The National, and Bon Iver), the most of any of Swift’s studio albums to date.
                
                In a post, Swift explained that her excitement over turning 31–her lucky number, 13, backwards–in 2020 was the reason for releasing evermore when she did. After years of fans giving her birthday gifts, she thought she would return the favor.<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i> <br/>

It was a surprise album, released on July 24, 2020, via Republic Records. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, Swift cancelled the concert tour for her seventh studio album Lover (2019). During quarantine, she conceived Folklore as "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness", and worked with producers Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff virtually, recording her vocals at an inbuilt studio in her Los Angeles residence, while Dessner and Antonoff operated from Hudson Valley and New York City, respectively.</p>
