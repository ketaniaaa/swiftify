      <section class="p-content" id="wireframeAnnotations">

        <hr id="wireframeDivider">
        <ol class="p-content" id="wireframeList">
          <li><p id="wfSmall"> Navigation - 

            The navigation is quite simple and since
            
            it only consists of 4 links, I have decided to keep this uniform across devices. To
            
            ensure that the navigation is uniform on
            
            smaller screens, I will add simple media
            
            queries to reduce the space between the
            
            title and the links.
            
            The font for the navigation will be IM
            
            FELL PICA as this is the primary font for
            
            the site.
            
            As this font is unique and intrinsinctly
            
            linked to Taylor Swift's brand, this acts as
            
            brand identification and therefore
            
            resulted in my decision to forego the use
            
            of a specific logo in the nav bar.
            
            The simple navigation is therefore easy
            
            to understand and adheres to the
            
            minimalist feel I aim to achieve </p></li>
          <li><p id="wfSmall">Title - 

            The home page will say Taylor Swift. This
            
            is to alert the user what the site is about.</p></li>
          <li><p id="wfSmall"> Image -

            The home image will be an image of
            
            Taylor Swift. Because I wanted the home
            
            page to be quite minimal, a photo that is
            
            inline with the theme of the site seemed
            
            like an appropriate choice to add more
            
            context for the site while not overloading
            
            the Ul of this page.
            
            These elements are aligned to the center
            
            in order to establish visual hierarchy as
            
            the visual elements are in focused view
            
            for the user.</p></li>
          <li><p id="wfSmall">Call to Action - 

            This text is used to inform the user why
            
            they should log in and click the button.
            
            This short description gives further
            
            context for the page.</p></li>
          <li><p id="wfSmall"> Log In Button -

            This button will be filled in with a colour
            
            darker than the tones of the rest of the
            
            page to establish visual hierarchy. This
            
            draws the users attention to the button
            
            as the functionality of this page is reliant
            
            on the button.
            
            This button allows the user to
            
            authenticate the Spotify API request and
            
            will start the chart calls.</p></li>
          <li><p id="wfSmall">footer - 

            This is a simple footer that will stay
            
            consistent across the entire site. This
            
            consists of my name so that the user is
            
            aware of who made the site. I have also
            
            added links to other relevant links to the
            
            creation of the site that is of more
            
            interest to my markers than to a
            
            recreational visitor of the site. This allows
            
            markers access to code references, my
            
            figma file for more insight into my design
            
            and the documentation for the spotify
            
            api.
            
            The Footer is created using the same
            
            font as the navigation bar but in a much
            
            smaller font-size and lower opacity
            
            because this is secondary information
            
            that does not need to be initially
            
            apparent to the user.</p></li>

              <li><p>Mini Navigation - 

                the mininavigation makes use of a simple
                
                list to help the user navigate between
                
                blog posts. The first link is a tag to
                
                navigate to the references. The other
                
                links allow easy access to different blogs</p></li>
              <li><p>Heading -

                The heading consists of the title of the
                
                blog post and a short summary, along
                
                with the author of the post and the date
                
                it was created. This information will be in
                
                IM FELL PICA because this important
                
                information that the user should be
                
                immediately aware of.
                
                The short description allows the user to
                
                understand what the post is about
                
                instead of having to read a large body of
                
                text before deciding if the post is what
                
                they wanted to read</p></li>
              <li><p> Body -

                The body of the blog post is centered to
                
                ensure that all the text is in comfortable
                
                reading position. I have differentiated the
                
                importance between body and title by
                
                changing the text to Over Pass Mono.
                
                This is a more readable font that IM FELL
                
                and therefore is better suited for longer</p></li>
              <li><p>References -

                the reference list is also in Overpass
                
                Mono yet there is a background colour to
                
                visually distinguish this compnent from
                
                the body</p></li>
              <li><p> Button Navigation -

                The buttons at the bottom of the page
                
                allow the user to quickly navigate
                
                between the previous blog post and the
                
                next post for easier navigation, rather
                
                than forcing the user to return to the blog
                
                selection page.</p></li>

              I have since revised these wireframes with low-fidelity wireframes to show my initial planning steps.

        <p class="e-content">
         I initially wanted to recreate a site that looked similar to the spotify site. This is because at that time, I wanted to create data visualizations that focused on the user instead of 
         a specific artist. When doing research, I found sites that used specific artists as the basis for using the Spotify Web API. This included the website 
         <a href="http://sixdegreesofkanyewest.com/" target= "_blank" class="u-url"> Six Degrees of Kanye West</a>, which uses the "Related Artist" endpoint to return data. I was interested in the idea of 
         creating a site that focused on one artist. I chose Taylor Swift as the artist to focus my site on mainly because there are large datasets regarding her 
         discography on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=taylor+swift" target="_blank" class="u-url">Kaggle</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>The inspiration of the site is largely based on the imagery from her album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1pzvBxYgT6OVwJLtHkrdQK?si=b99AwAufT22ZzbNzls2tFg" target="_blank" class="u-url">Folklore</a>. 
        Taylor Swift tends to have different imagery based on different albums and so creating a site that encapsulated all her work seemed aesthetically messy. Folklore tends to use mainly black and white and the 
        photoshoot that she did for this album was taken in meadows and forest hence, a lot of greenery. This is why the background images consist of green specs and the text being in black. 
       I have populated the site with the images from her Folklore album shoot. The special vinyl edition of her album Evermore, is pressed using a forest green pigment, hence the inspiration
       for the site.
    
    </p>
    <p> I wanted to create a minimalist website and was largely influenced by editorial design to achieve this. The use of negative space therefore allows for a more open feeling, rather than
        overwhelming the user with a lot of content everywhere.

                The main font for the site, IM FELL Pica, is the font that has been used for Taylor Swift's recent albums Folklore and Evermore. Since the site is targeted towards Taylor Swift fans,
                the font is easily recognisable. This font is used for all headings and titles. In order to create visual heirachy, I have resized, bolded and italicized elements that are not headings 
                that use this font.
        </p>
        <p> I have used the font Overpass Mono for bodies of large text. This is seen here, in the design guide and in blog posts. This font is monospace and therefore easier to read that IM FELL Pica. I have 
            also chosen this font because it looks vaguely like a typewriter font. The imagery from Folklore which inspired this site used vintage imagery and therefore this font is 
            congruent with the theme of the site.
