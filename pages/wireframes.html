<h3>Home Page</h3>

<section id="wfSection">

<img class="wfImg" src="../assets/home - top artists.png" alt="Wireframes for the Home Page">

<ol class="wfAn">
<li> <h4>1. Header</h4>
  <p>
   
    The header is similar to the Spotify
    website as It is a dark band across the
    top with the logo and name of the site
    aligned to the let. The header contains
    the two fonts used throughout the
    website. Questrial is used for the name of
    the website and used throughout the site
    for headings and titles. The tab text font
    family is Work Sans, a sans-serif font
    which is recommended by the Spotify
    Design Guidelines for secondary text.
    
</p>

 </li>
<li><h4>2. Banner </h4>
<p>
the banner will display the purpose of the
website and the use of the API. There is
an image of a line chart which will be
replaced with a site-related data image
as decoration. Finally, there is a button at
the bottom of the banner which is in a
bold colour to draw the user's attention to
it. This button will be a link to the data
artwork that is being advertised.

</p>
</li>

<li>   <h4>3. Call to Action</h4>
<p>
 
  the call to action will give a short
  explanation as to why this Idea Is
  interesting or why a user might want to
  use a site of this nature
  The four circular bars are placeholders
  for images of CDs as this website is
  music themed. This use of circular
  images are used throughout the website to
  simulate the form of CDs and vinyls.
  Under each will be a short explanation of
  the different data visualizations that I will
  create throughout the semester for the
  user to be able to understand the fully
  purpose of the website upon immediate
  entry of the site.
  
</p>
</li>

<li> 
<h4>4. Footer </h4> <p>
  
  The footer remains the same across all
  pages of the website and will be a
  reusable component. The footer has links
  to references used to create the website
  on the right and on the left are social
  media links. The footer, like the header
  has a bold background that is contrasted
  against the light background of the rest
  of the page to indicate a visual
  difference.

<h3 id="theory"> Selection Pages </h3>

<section id="wfSection">



<ol class="wfAn">
<li> 
  <h4>1. Navigation </h4> <p>
   
    The navigation of the website is simple.
    The text links state where the user is
    navigating to and clicking on the logo or
    the "Statify" text will direct the user back
    to the home page. In order to visually
    indicate where in the site the user is, the
    links in the navigation bar will change
    text color and will become underlined
    while on that specific page or section.
    change for wireframes
   
    
</p>
 </li>
 <h4>2. Change for Wireframes  </h4><p>
 
Here I need to change the style of the
title text for the blogs. The explanation of
the design reasoning for this display as
opposed to the conventional card
selection is explained in the annotations
for the design page.
</p>

<h3> Blog Template</h3>

 <section id="wfSection">

<img class="wfImg" src="../assets/blog template.png" alt="Wireframes for the Theory Selection Page">

<ol class="wfAn">
<li> 
   <h4> 1. Blog title</h4><p>

The blog title is in bold Questrial to draw
attention to the title of the blog

</p>
 </li>
<li> 
<h4>2. Blog Information</h4><p>

The skeleton acts as a short description
of the site for the user to easily identify
the key ideas regarding the blog post. I
have also included a circular icon for the
name of the author and a timestamp to
date the post. This is to make the blog
posts seem more realistic, like normal
blog posts.

</p>
</li>

<li> 
 <h4>3. Blog Picture</h4>
<p>

An image for the blog in a circular shape
to follow the style of the rest of the site.
This also breaks up the large amount of
text on the blog post to keep the user
engaged. In the actual website, I have removed the image because I felt that it was unnecessary
</p>
 </li>

 <li> 
  <h4>4. Blog References</h4> <p>

  The reference list is contained in a block
with a darker background in order to
visually differentiate the reference list
from the actual blog post

  </p>
   </li>

   <li> 
    <h4>5. Blog Buttons</h4> <p>
  
    The wireframes depict buttons that can
redirect the user to different blog posts.

    </p>
     </li>
</ol>
</section>




<h3 id="dv"> Data Visualization</h3>
<section id="wfSection">

 
 <ol class="wfAn">
   
<li>
<h4>1. Title </h4>
<p>
  The title is in bolded Questrial for visual
  hierarchy, reinforcing to the user that the
  important titles of pages are in the same
  font and size
  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>2. Data Visualization  </h4>
<p>
  This image is a placeholder for the data
  visualization. The image is large and in
  the center of the page to immediately
  draw the users attention to it. This is the
  main subject matter of the page and
  therefore must be the first thing that the
  user experiences
  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>3. Description </h4>
<p>
  To the left of the actual data visualization
  is the description of the piece to give the
  user more information. This is secondary
  information and therefore is set to the
  side to allow the users gaze to naturally
  drift to after the visualization. Providing a
  description and rationale for the data
  visualisation ensures that the piece is
  accessible to users who are not reliant on
  receiving visual information to
  understand the site.
  There is a bolded skeleton text when the
  references for the piece will be
      
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>4. Button Navigation </h4>
<p>
  I have added a button navigation to allow
the user to quickly navigate to the next
data visualization quickly. This in-page
navigation is a convention of articles. The
bold outline of the button allows for it to
stand out against the background of the
page for easy visual identification

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>5. Post Navigation Drawer </h4>
<p>
  This is a simple drawer that allows the
  user to see all the available data
  visualizations at a glance and provides
  quick navigations to the other data
  visualisation posts
  
</p>
</li>
 </ol>

 <h2 id="da"> Data Art</h3>
 <section id="wfSection">
  <img class="wfImg" src="../assets/home - top artistshover.png" alt="Wireframes for the Home Page">
   
   <ol class="wfAn">
    <li>
      <h4>1. Nav Bar </h4>
      <p>
        This is a small navigation bar for the user
to navigate the post as the data-art
posts will be longer pieces, This will use
hooks to redirect the user to a particular
section of the article with ease.
This prevents the user from having to
scroll to look for relevant information and
provides ease of taskmanagement in
order to keep the user engaged

    </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h4>2. Main Artwork </h4>
      <p>
        This big image will be the main artwork. It
is position in the center of the page for
easy identification and to establish the
visual hierarchy of the page

        
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>3. Artwork Gallery </h4>
      <p>
        This is a gallery for the data-art that will
        depict zoomed-in portions of the
        artwork. This feature is both functional
        and aesthetic.
        The functionality of this gallery is for the
        user to see the artwork better and view
        the piece in great detail.
        The aesthetic value of this is to replicate
        a digital gallery and to establish this page
        as one to view and experience digital art
        
        
    </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h4>4. Overview </h4>
      <p>
        A short description of the artwork. This
summary of the piece allows users to
option of reading this only instead of the
full rationale, which can seem like an
overwhelming amount of information to
some users. The implementation of this
overview therefore reflects flexibility in
the site.

        
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>5. Rationale </h4>
      <p>
        The rationale of the artwork follows the
same layout as the other blog posts on
the site for uniformity and consistency

        
    </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h4>6. Next Button </h4>
      <p>
        This navigation button allows the user to
        rapidly navigate between artworks
        instead of going back to the main page
        to navigate. This allows for a more
        seamless experience of the artwork that
        simulates the action of wafting through a
        gallery to new artworks. This ease of
        navigation is therefore an important
        feature in order to create the specific
        experience that I intend for the user.

<h2> Outdated Wireframes </h2>
