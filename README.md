## swiftify - interactive media project


# This website is deployed on Netlify


Click here: [Swiftify](https://swiftify.netlify.app/)

I have hosted the site on Netlify for faster deployment  at **https://swiftify.netlify.app/** 

It is ***crucial*** to use the Netlify url rather than GitHub Pages because my API call ball uri that I have put on the Spotify Developer Dashboard is https://swiftify.netlify.app/ 
If you do not use this link, you will not be able to view any visualizations or the site at all because there will be an INCORRECT_URI alert that will prevent the use of the 
github site! This link allows the OAuth process to be returned :)!


### To-Do 
* add visual to chart section on index.html after logging in 
* add back buttons for charts i.e mini nav but not with button tages 
* media queries
